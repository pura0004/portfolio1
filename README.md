# Jishnu' Portfolio

## My Self-Promoting website

### Objective 

This objective of this website is to showcase the skills and projects that I have learned throughout my first year in the IMD program. Although I still have a lot to learn, my skills have improved, I am still in that learning process. Although not everything is perfect, I do learn from mistakes and  try to improve my skills. I hope that in the near future I will be able to master those skills and build on my portfolio. 



# About the creation of the project

The project started in the UX design class,  we were all give an assignment to design a design prototype of our "portfolio". Various ideas started to emerge and a portfolio mockup was created. With the designed prototype in mind, some research was made about portfolios.

Firstly, I created the HTML and CSS home page code with the mobile-first approach. Then, the tablet and finally the desktop version.

After having the main structure, I created the homepage and linked the other pages .create the about, projects, and contact pages Then, the paper, thank you, and prototype subpages. For every HTML file, I had to adjust the CSS code to get the final result. When I finished the HTML and CSS code for every webpage, I validated my code using the W3 Validator for CSS and HTML. In some cases, I had to correct the HTML errors and css errors. 

After the having checked the html & css, I submitted the files to the Github repository stage for the changes, writing a message to commit and pushing the changes. Finally, I tested and corrected some errors. The project ended on April 20th, 2022 with a satisfactory result.

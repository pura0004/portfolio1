# Jishnu' Portfolio

## My Self-Promoting website

### Objective :

This objective of this website is to showcase the skills and projects that I have learned throughout my first year in the IMD program. Although I still have a lot to learn, my skills have improved, I am still in that learning process. Although not everything is perfect, I do learn from mistakes and  try to improve my skills. I hope that in the near future I will be able to master those skills more and build on my portfolio. 



# About the creation of the project :

The project started in the UX design class,  we were all give an assignment to design a design prototype of our "portfolio". Various ideas started to emerge and a portfolio mockup was created. With the designed prototype in mind, some research was made about portfolios.

Firstly, I created the HTML and CSS home page code with the mobile-first approach. Then, the tablet and finally the desktop version.
Moreover, I also use derivv.com to resize all the images that I used and put them in an image folder. Ialso used https://formito.com/ to create my favicon.(Which is a pretty cool website)

In addition, I created the homepage and linked the other pages, create the portfolio, about, and contact pages. I had to adjust the CSS codes to style the pages. Then, when I finished the HTML and CSS code for every webpage, I validated my code using the W3 Validator for bothe CSS and HTML. I did encouter some errors and  had to correct the HTML  and css errors. 
Finally After the having checked the html & css, I submitted the files to the Github repository stage for the changes,  to commit and pushing the changes. 

## Challenges faced during build-up :

1. Resizing of the images, first i was using photoshop and illustrator and then I this little but useful website which is derivv.com.
2. Some of the css was not applying to my elements and had to workaround and do a little bit more reaearch to fix them.
3. Grid & Flexbox, I still have to learn more about them.

# What I learned

 Writing the wrong syntax can lead to "frustration"  sometimes, in both html and css the slightest error can lead to "hours why is this not working" 

# Assets used for build up

- derivv.com for resize of images
- formito.com/  for the favicon
- cdnjs.cloudflare.com for the social media icons

### Thanks for the semester, I learned a lot! I will keep working on this site to make it good enough to send to employers in the future.

Cheers,
